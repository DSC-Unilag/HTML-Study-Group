                In year 2018, I volunteered to usher at Engineering Career Expo 1.0, in year 2019, I was part of the competitors
                during the cash in trash symposium which is also referred to as the Cash Simulation program by NSChE Unilag Chapter.
                <br/>At the end of the program my team emerged the winner, with the best problem solving idea, In that same here, I also participated in the
                ART (Academic Resource Team) program where my team also emerged the winner of the quiz competition. During the 2019 break, I learnt graphics design
                which I am still working on and I am presently using as a volunteer for the Engineering Career Expo Graphics Team. 
                During this COVID-19 break, I took up learning programming and on a journey to become a Front-End Developer. I am presently skilled with graphics design, programming 
                using Python and Javascript. I look forward to learning more skills and working as a Web Developer.
