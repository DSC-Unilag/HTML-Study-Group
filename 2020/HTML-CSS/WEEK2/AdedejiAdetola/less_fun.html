    <p>Welcome to the less fun part of me! More like the "serious" fun part of me ... lol. 
      What I mean by less fun is, things I find interesting but relative to the world are not in the class of interesting.
      So, let's get straight into it and I hope you enjoy it.</p>
    <p>I love reading some books that are quite out of the world, but a wise man once said "feed your curiousity". I also listen to epic classical music. I'm not much of a social media person, it feels more like a chore to me. lol. Not everyone finds solving the rubik's cube fun but I do. I love chess also but I dunno how to play it (How sad..lol.).</p>
    <p class="end">Finally, I love to code!</p>
