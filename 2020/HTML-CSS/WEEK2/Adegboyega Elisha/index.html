        <p class="about">
            My name is Adegboyega Elisha,I'm popularly called Jaybee. I'm currently in Part 3 of the department of Linguistics and African Languages in the Faculty of Arts. I really love coding so much,I feel priviledged to know about it. I love reading books that teach about growth, I'm always ready to learn, I'm approachable,jovial and love communications especially with strangers though I could be shy at first.
