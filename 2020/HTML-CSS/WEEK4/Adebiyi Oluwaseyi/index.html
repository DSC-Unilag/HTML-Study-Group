    <p class="intro">The following properties are the core aspects of a website:</p>
    <main class="main">
        <section id="section-1">
            <h2 class="sub-title">Keep It Clean</h2>
            <p>
                Great design is all about simplicity; you don't want to get in the way of your visitors. If there's too
                much going on , lots of confusing colors, mixed messages, overwhelming visuals, confusing
                menu structures, competing popups, etc. then people are more likely to get turned off.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="section-2">
            <h2 class="sub-title">Cross-Device Responsiveness</h2>
            <p>
                These days, more business is done on cell phones and tablets than on traditional desktop
                computers. That means your website needs to work on cell phones and tablets as well. Having a
                responsive website ensures your site looks great across all devices and screen sizes.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="section-3">
            <h2 class="sub-title">Branded Elements</h2>
            <p>
                Your website is the digital reflection of your industrial brand, and it should accurately and
                positively represent your company. That means sticking to your core color scheme, utilizing a
                crisp and high-resolution logo, and working in your core messaging and value proposition. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="section-4">
            <h2 class="sub-title">Easy and flexible Customer Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Navigation is an often-overlooked aspect of web design, but it is an element that can make or
                break your success. You need to ensure that getting around your site is as simple and intuitive as
                possible, so that visitors can find the content and information they need without getting lost, and
                without getting frustrated.</p>
