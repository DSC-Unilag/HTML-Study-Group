            <h3>ARRIVING LATE</h3>
            <p>Punctuality is a quality employers look out for in an employee.Same goes for schools.Arriving late for an interview only portrays for you an image of a nonchalant worker or student which is not in anyway favorable for your application.
                It would be best if you put into consideration traffic,time for journey and other factors that could decrease your ability to be punctual and properly manage your time so you can arrive on time.</p>

        <section id="dressing">
            <h3>INAPPROPRIATE DRESSING</h3>
            <P>As you dress,so shall you be addressed.You give a poor impression of yourself when you wear inappropriate clothes like party costume or dress shabbily.It would be an advantage to you if you dress smart,professional and neat for your interview.If you are confused,you can search for ‘how to dress for an interview’ on Google
                 or other search engines to gain more insights on how to dress appropriately for an interview.</P>

        <section id="manners">
            <h3>BAD MANNERS</h3>
            <p>Being too casual at greeting or abrasive posture are acts that do not play in your favor during an interview.It is expected that you show a certain amount of respect to your employers because it goes a long way in communicating to your employer the kind of employee you would turn out to be.It also shows the employer how well you would work in groups or teams.
                It is definitely necessary you keep your behaviour in check during an interview.</p>

        <section id="interest">
            <h3>LACK OF INTEREST IN THE INTERVIEWER</h3>
            <p>It is highly advised that you read up about your interviewer or your recruiter before the interview so the interview would in no way be passive and you would not appear boring or uninteresting to the interviewer.
                Try to actively engage in conversations with your interviewer but still at the same time keep your etiquette in check.</p>

        <section id="ego">
            <h3>OVERCONFIDENCE AND EGO</h3>
            <p>Confidence is important.
                Employers look for it,but at the same time excessive ego is repulsive so avoid it.</p>
