Hi there! Thanks for visiting.
So this page was built based on practice, It hardly contains relevant information but I'm happy I was able to pull this up (humble beginnings).

# cons
This site is only responsive on desktop/web. I started learning to code again last month and I'm really taking it slowly and hopeful this time. 
# tech
I built this using HTML and CSS, being the only two technologies I know for now. I'd hopefully be updating this site as I go deep into front-end Development.
Contibutions are also welcomed!
