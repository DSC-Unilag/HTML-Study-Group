        <h3>School & Experience</h3>
        <p>
          I am currently studying in the University of Lagos(B.Ed in
          Mathematics). I am in my 3rd year. I have been practing code and
          learning about the front end for little over a while and I intend to
          also dive into the back end development to achieve my goal as a full
          stack software develoer.
