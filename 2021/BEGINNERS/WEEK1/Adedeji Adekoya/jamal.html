        I hail from Ogun state and i'm actually an Ijebu boy, but my type of ijebu is not stingy. I'm aspiring to study philosopy in 
        <a href="unilag.edu.ng"  style="font-style: italic; cursor: pointer;">University Of Lagos.</a>
         I'm willing to become a front end developer. I attended <i>Solutions Group Of School.</i>
         I'm a per time introvert,maybe just knowing someone for the first time,but when you get to know me more, you all will know 
         that i'm funny and not a boring a type.</p> -->

       <p> <b>Introduction</b> <br>
        	&emsp; &emsp;Hey, this my homepage, so i have to say something about myself. Some times it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give you a trial to see what kind of image youhave about methrough my self descriotion. I hope that my impression about myself and yours about me are so different. so, here it goes.<br>
        	&emsp; &emsp; I am a person who is positive about everyaspect of life. There are many things i like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, i like to write, i like to think, i like to dream; i like to talk, i like to listen. i like to see the sunrise in the morning, i like to see the shines at night, i like to feel the music flowing on my face, i line to smell the wind comig from the ocean, i like to do thought experimennt when i cannot sleep, i like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind. I love the nature and the  lands, i like people and i like playing guitar.<br>
        	&emsp; &emsp; I want to be a <b>front end dev.</b> I also want to be a great <b>Philosopher,</b> like Aristotle, who talks about idealism and realism of life, though still an aspirant of <b>UNILAG</b>. I am nowhere close to people. so this is a brief introduvtion of myself. If you are interested in knowing more, read my article <a href="article.com">CodonJnr.com</a>
