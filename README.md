### STEP 1

#### How do i get to do that?
**Fork the repo**:-

- visit our dsc repo link here [repo Link](https://github.com/DSC-Unilag/HTML-Study-Group).

### STEP 2
##### clone the repo
- Now go to your terminal, could be powershell, command prompt or git bash, 
- you can search for git bash on your system and then launch it. 
- git bash is installed alongside git.
## termux
termux users will have to setup their storage access first by running .
``` termux-setup-storage ```
- it will prompt for permission to access your android storage, allow it.
- something that termux users should note is that, file created outside storage/shared, your phone device cant access them only termux can access them, so incase you have a mobile editor for writting your code, you would love to make it acccessible. 
- to do that you will have to make termux point to storage/shared 
- so do ```cd storage/shared ```
## etrm

- now enter this
``` git clone "the link you copied from the code button  ```
*** ensure to click enter whenever u copy/type a command ***

now you should see something similar to the image below

![cloning terminal](https://i.ibb.co/PW2DvpN/Screenshot-680.png "cloning repo")

- now enter this ```ls```
- names of files in your current directory will be listed, try checking if you will see the html-study-group folder

- after then cd/enter into the html-study-group folder
```cd html-study-group```

### STEP 3
##### checkout to beginners braanch
- you will have to enter into the branch containing the 2021/Beginner/Week1+ folder (Note wmeek1+ means it applies for week1-8), so to do that, type
``` git checkout cohort2_beginners ```


### STEP 4
##### submitting your assignment
- use your file explorer/file manager to open the html-study-group folder.
- you will see the 2021 folder, open it, then you will see the week1 folder.
- when you open the week 1 folder you will see a submission.md file.
- inside the week1 folder, create your assignment folder.
- if you have already done your assignment in another folder, copy it and place it in the 2021 folder.
- ensure that your assignment folder name is your fullname.
- once you are done with your assignment open the submmision.md file.
- you will see a sample format for filling your submission details,
eg
## fullname - foldername - whatsappnumber
- JohnDoe - JohnDoe - 0701234567

- once you are done with the above step go back to your terminal, 
- ensure that you have cd into the html-study-group directory already
- then stage and commit your files like this
``` 
    git add *
    git commit -m "commit message"
 ```
 where commit message could be anything to reflect the changes you did to the file, eg "i finished my week 1 assignment"
 
 #### push
 - so you will have to push your changes
 by doing
 ``` git push ```
 
 ### Step 5
 ##### create a pull Request
 - inorder for the tutors to view and grade your submissions, you will have to create a pull request from the cohort2_beginners branch on your forked repo.
 - there is a likely hood that after your push you will see a big brown button at the top of your forked repo with a compare and pull request button 
 just click on it and it will take you directly to the create pull request view.
