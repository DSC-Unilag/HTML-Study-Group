            My name is Adegboyega Elisha,I'm popularly called Jaybee. I'm currently in Part 3 of the department of Linguistics and African Languages in the Faculty of Arts. I really love coding so much,I feel priviledged to know about it. I feel supernatural when I write code and it goes as planned. I have my future planned out within website because I know website is broad but I know within myself i'm not giving coding the best and time i'm suposed to give it. DSC thanks for being part of my story.
